This is documentation for the translation.js and translation.py approach



	Advantages:  Build out of basic fuctionality is complete

	Disadvantages:  Partially done in Javascript, some of the team may not be familiar.  
	
  Known bugs:   There is a session timeout issue and audio input pauses that are documented in the code, 
			but I am confident these issues can be overcome. 
      


Set up for Chrome browsers.  Both SpeechSynthesisUtterance and webkitSpeechRecognition are maintained by each browser respectively, in this case Google.  
You must have your computer audio configured correctly, specify the device output from chrome to a headset.  
If audio is loud enough it will get feedback and repeat, this is expected for this use case and is not an issue.
