This is documentation for the translation.js and translation.py approach



	Advantages:  Build out of basic fuctionality is complete

	Disadvantages:  Partially done in Javascript, some of the team may not be familiar.  
	
  Known bugs:   There is a session timeout issue and audio input pauses that are documented in the code, 
			but I am confident these issues can be overcome. 
      


Set up for Chrome browsers only.  Please perform a "hard reload" to ensure your browser downloads the lastest javascript update.  
Both SpeechSynthesisUtterance and webkitSpeechRecognition are maintained by each browser respectively, in this case Google.  
You must have your computer audio configured correctly.  You may have to take the chrome output off of "default" audio output and specify the device via the "app volume and device preferences" in windows.  
If audio is loud enough it will get feedback and repeat, this is expected for this use case and is not an issue.
