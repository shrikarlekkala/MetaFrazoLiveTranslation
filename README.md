Project Title: Real-Time Audio Translation and Distribution Software for Multilingual Church Services
Project Description:
This project aims to develop a comprehensive and scalable software solution that facilitates real-time
translation and audio distribution of church services conducted in various languages. While our
immediate client is a U.S. church delivering services in Romanian, the goal is to create a universal
solution that can be employed by churches worldwide to accommodate different language needs of their
congregations.
The software system will incorporate real-time translation technology with existing audio distribution
systems, converting non-English sermons into English and disseminating the translated content to
attendees through their individual headsets. The solution will be scalable and flexible, allowing other
churches to leverage this technology and integrate it into their exisƟng infrastructure.
Key Technical Components:
1. Audio Input Interface: This component digitizes spoken language by connecƟng a microphone to
a computer via a USB interface, transforming the sermon into processable audio data.
2. Automatic Speech RecogniƟon (ASR): ASR technology will be employed to transcribe the
sermon's spoken language into text data.
3. Machine Translation (MT): A sophisticated MT model will then translate the sermon's
transcribed text into English, addressing the complexities and nuances of the original language.
4. Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS): The translated English text will be converted back into audio
using TTS technology, allowing the English rendition of the sermon to be audibly delivered.
5. Audio Output Interface: The translated English audio will be transmitted to a headphone jack,
connecting it to the church's existing headset distribution system for live dissemination among
attendees.
6. Scalable Software Architecture: The software will be designed with scalability as a key attribute,
enabling other churches to implement the same solution seamlessly. This will be achieved
through flexible APIs and modular components, making integration with existing church systems
possible.
7. User Interface and Experience (UI/UX): The soŌware will feature a user-friendly interface that
requires minimal technical expertise, ensuring that church staff can easily operate it. It will also
offer a robust and intuitive administrative console for managing user accounts, language
settings, and other configurations.
8. Cloud-Based Deployment: To ensure scalability and ease of access, the software will be
deployed on a secure cloud platform, allowing churches to use the service on a subscription
basis. This eliminates the need for substanƟal hardware investments, making the solution more
accessible for churches of all sizes.

By implemenƟng this real-time audio translation and distribution software, we can greatly improve
language accessibility during church services, ensuring inclusivity for all attendees regardless of their
language proficiency. The software is designed with growth in mind, ready to accommodate an
increasing number of users or additional languages in the future.
