Project Title: Real-Ɵme Audio TranslaƟon and DistribuƟon SoŌware for MulƟlingual Church Services
Project DescripƟon:
This project aims to develop a comprehensive and scalable soŌware soluƟon that facilitates real-Ɵme
translaƟon and audio distribuƟon of church services conducted in various languages. While our
immediate client is a U.S. church delivering services in Romanian, the goal is to create a universal
soluƟon that can be employed by churches worldwide to accommodate different language needs of their
congregaƟons.
The soŌware system will incorporate real-Ɵme translaƟon technology with exisƟng audio distribuƟon
systems, converƟng non-English sermons into English and disseminaƟng the translated content to
aƩendees through their individual headsets. The soluƟon will be scalable and flexible, allowing other
churches to leverage this technology and integrate it into their exisƟng infrastructure.
Key Technical Components:
1. Audio Input Interface: This component digiƟzes spoken language by connecƟng a microphone to
a computer via a USB interface, transforming the sermon into processable audio data.
2. AutomaƟc Speech RecogniƟon (ASR): ASR technology will be employed to transcribe the
sermon's spoken language into text data.
3. Machine TranslaƟon (MT): A sophisƟcated MT model will then translate the sermon's
transcribed text into English, addressing the complexiƟes and nuances of the original language.
4. Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS): The translated English text will be converted back into audio
using TTS technology, allowing the English rendiƟon of the sermon to be audibly delivered.
5. Audio Output Interface: The translated English audio will be transmiƩed to a headphone jack,
connecƟng it to the church's exisƟng headset distribuƟon system for live disseminaƟon among
aƩendees.
6. Scalable SoŌware Architecture: The soŌware will be designed with scalability as a key aƩribute,
enabling other churches to implement the same soluƟon seamlessly. This will be achieved
through flexible APIs and modular components, making integraƟon with exisƟng church systems
possible.
7. User Interface and Experience (UI/UX): The soŌware will feature a user-friendly interface that
requires minimal technical experƟse, ensuring that church staff can easily operate it. It will also
offer a robust and intuiƟve administraƟve console for managing user accounts, language
seƫngs, and other configuraƟons.
8. Cloud-Based Deployment: To ensure scalability and ease of access, the soŌware will be
deployed on a secure cloud plaƞorm, allowing churches to use the service on a subscripƟon
basis. This eliminates the need for substanƟal hardware investments, making the soluƟon more
accessible for churches of all sizes.

By implemenƟng this real-Ɵme audio translaƟon and distribuƟon soŌware, we can greatly improve
language accessibility during church services, ensuring inclusivity for all aƩendees regardless of their
language proficiency. The soŌware is designed with growth in mind, ready to accommodate an
increasing number of users or addiƟonal languages in the future.
