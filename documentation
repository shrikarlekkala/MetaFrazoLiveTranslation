Video to text transcription using OpenAI-Whisper package.

Current procedure:

Manually upload the video and adjust the file name in the code.
Execute the code.
Advantages:

Offers higher accuracy compared to other APIs, approximately 92% accuracy (may vary depending on the specific model used). Reference: https://github.com/openai/whisper
Implementation is straightforward, simplifying the process.
Supports multiple languages.
Capable of handling diverse accents, background noise, and technical language.
Disadvantages:

Cannot be utilized for real-time translation; the package only accepts pre-recorded audio files for transcription.
The duration of the recording is a hyperparameter that must be set based on requirements, API processing time, and specific use case.
Multiple models are available, ranging from lightweight to heavy. Choosing the most suitable model depends on factors such as computational resources, acceptable time delay, and performance requirements.


Listen to any audio stream on your machine and print out the transcribed or translated audio.

Advantage:

	It Translates the Audio from any device to Text Accuracy is up to 92%.
	python audioWhisper.py Translate It give the Text Translate from Original Audio to English Language
	If we give Transcribe, then it will give the Text of Original Language.

Disadvantage:

	The translated Text is not perfect, but it can still translate the point of the talk from audio.
	It has more Time Delay.
	Sometimes it won’t give Accurate Text.
	It provides the Text as Subtitle, but the requirement is to get the text at a time.
